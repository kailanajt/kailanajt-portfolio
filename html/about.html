    <p id="about-me" class ='decriptions'>
       Hey there! <br>
        My name is Kailana Thompson and I am currently 21 years old. <br>
        I was born in a small town in the state of
        Virginia and moved to <br>
        Galveston Island, Texas when I was about 10 years old. <br>
        Writing and dabbling in learning new languages of the world has <br> always
        been a passion of mine, and when I turned 20, I decided to  <br>
        completely step out of my comfort-zone and pursue a language only <br>
        certain individuals can speak: the langauge of Code.<br>
